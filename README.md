# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of Amazon’s Vine program.  Specifically, we chose to analyze a dataset that contained 960,782 rows of data about wristwatches that were available for sale on Amazon.  To begin, we created a public database via Amazon RDS, and linked our pgAdmin server with this RDS instance.  Once this was done, we created SQL queries to create blank tables in pgAdmin that would ultimately hold the wristwatch data.  After our pgAdmin tables were set up, we used Google Colab and PySpark to manipulate the wristwatch data to have only the specific columns and data types that we needed in order to import the data into pgAdmin.  Upon manipulating the data successfully, we imported the data into the pgAdmin tables so that we could export the table of data involving the Amazon Vine members as a csv file.  Finally, once we had this csv file, we imported it into Jupyter Notebook and used the Python library, Pandas, to manipulate the data further to determine if there were biases present in the reviews that Amazon Vine members wrote.  


## Results
The following is a list of the results of our analysis with screenshots of the referenced DataFrames that we created.  It is to be noted that as part of the Amazon Vine program, companies pay a small fee for Amazon to send products to select customers, who then write reviews about said products, hence why the following screenshots below associate the word “paid” with reviews written by Amazon Vine members, and the word “unpaid” is associated with the reviews that were written by Amazon users that were not members of the Vine program. 
* We found that out of the total number of helpful Amazon reviews, there were 47 Amazon Vine reviews and 8,362 non-Vine reviews

* There were 15 five-star Amazon Vine reviews and 4,332 five-star reviews not written by members of Amazon’s Vine program.

* We also calculated that approximately 31.91% of Vine reviews were five-star reviews, and that approximately 51.81% of non-Vine reviews were five-stars.

## Summary
Judging from the results above, we can see that there are significantly more non-Vine reviews than there are Vine reviews.  This is not surprising, though, as Amazon specifically selects users that consistently write thorough reviews to be members of their program, and as most Amazon members do not write product reviews after purchasing a product, it is reasonable that the number of Vine reviews is significantly lower than non-Vine reviews.  More importantly, we see that Vine members seem to give significantly less five-star ratings than those who are not members of the Amazon Vine program.  There are a number of reasons that this could be the case.  Vine members are chosen by Amazon for their consistent and thorough reviews on products that they have purchased.  Thus, it may be the case that Vine members are more likely to give lower reviews, as they are more comprehensive in how they review products.  A small detail that a general user may not find significant about a product may be a bigger sticking point to Vine members, hence why the percentages above are so much lower than Amazon members that are not a part of the Vine program.  Also, it is to be noted that the amount of data collected from Vine members is significantly smaller than users who are not a part of the Vine program, which may suggest that our data is not accurately representative of the true percentage of five-star reviews given by Vine members.  In an attempt to fix this issue, we could run a similar analysis across several Amazon datasets, comparing the percentages of five-star reviews from Vine members and members not a part of the Vine program to see if, generally, the percentages align more closely than what we have shown here.  However, based on the analysis done in this project, we conclude that Vine members seem to be biased towards giving more negative reviews than users of Amazon that are not members of the Vine program.
